<Meta of={stories} />

A table displays data in rows and columns and enables a user to navigate its
contents via directional navigation keys, and optionally supports row selection
and sorting.

It is a thin layer on top of the
[React Aria Table component](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Table.html)
with some additional props for styling / variants.

## Examples

<Canvas
    sourceState="shown"
    of={stories.Default}
/>
