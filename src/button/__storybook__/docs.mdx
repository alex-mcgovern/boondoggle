## Customization

In addition to the props provided by the
[React Aria Button component](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#props),
there are some additional props for customizing the appearance of the button,
`appearance`, `size`, `color` and `alignment`.

### Appearance

The `appearance` prop corresponds to the `variant` prop usually found in other
UI libraries, and supports the following options:

-   `primary`: For a primary action, e.g. submitting a form **(default)**
-   `secondary`: For a secondary action, e.g. canceling a form
-   `ghost`: For a ghost button, e.g. for a secondary action that should be less
    prominent

<Canvas of={stories.Primary} />

<Canvas of={stories.Secondary} />

<Canvas of={stories.Ghost} />

### Color

Button can be customized with the globally available `color`, this is intended
to be used to convey semantic meaning.

<Canvas of={stories.Red} />

<Canvas of={stories.Green} />

### Size

The `size` prop can be used to adjust the size of the button, and supports the
following options:

-   `sm` **(default)**
-   `md`
-   `lg`

<Canvas
    sourceState="none"
    of={stories.Size}
/>

### Square

The in addition to the `size` prop provided, you can set `square` to true for an
icon button.

<Canvas
    sourceState="none"
    of={stories.SizeSquare}
/>
