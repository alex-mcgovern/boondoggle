# Button

A button allows a user to perform an action, with mouse, touch, and keyboard
interactions.

It is a thin layer on top of the
[React Aria Button component](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html)
with some additional props for styling / variants.

## Example

<Source
    code={`\
import { Button } from "boondoggle/button";
    
<Button onPress={() => alert("Hello, world!")}>Press me</Button>`}
    language="tsx"
/>
<Canvas
    sourceState="none"
    of={stories.Example}
/>

## Customization

In addition to the props provided by the
[React Aria Button component](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Button.html#props),
there are some additional props for customizing the appearance of the button,
`appearance`, `size`, `colorOverlay` and `alignment`.

### Appearance

The `appearance` prop corresponds to the `variant` prop usually found in other
UI libraries, and supports the following options:

-   `primary`: For a primary action, e.g. submitting a form **(default)**
-   `secondary`: For a secondary action, e.g. canceling a form
-   `ghost`: For a ghost button, e.g. for a secondary action that should be less
    prominent

<Canvas
    sourceState="none"
    of={stories.Appearance}
/>

### Color

Button can be customized with the globally available `colorOverlay`, this is
intended to be used to convey semantic meaning, e.g.

-   `amber`: To indicate caution, or warning actions
-   `blue`: To indicate information, or neutral actions
-   `green`: To indicate success, or confirmatory actions
-   `grey`: When a subtle, neutral color is needed
-   `red`: To warn of potentially destructive actions
-   `default`: To reset the color overlay if inherited from a parent

<Canvas
    sourceState="none"
    of={stories.Colors}
/>

### Size

The `size` prop can be used to adjust the size of the button, and supports the
following options:

-   `xs`
-   `sm` **(default)**
-   `md`
-   `lg`
-   `square_xs`
-   `square_sm`
-   `square_md`
-   `square_lg`

<Canvas
    sourceState="none"
    of={stories.Size}
/>

### Playground

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

<Controls
    of={stories.Default}
    include={["appearance", "size", "colorOverlay", "alignment"]}
/>
