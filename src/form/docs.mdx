## Usage

### Example: Kitchen sink

This is a "kitchen sink" example of a form with various field types.

<Description of={stories.Default} />
<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

### Example: Composing a "confirm action" UI

Here is an example of composing a form with a text field that requires a
specific value to be entered before allowing submission.

This pattern is useful for confirming destructive actions, such as deleting a
user account.

<Description of={stories.ConfirmAction} />
<Canvas of={stories.ConfirmAction} />
