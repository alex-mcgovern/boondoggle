<Meta of={stories} />

# TextField

<Description of={TextField} />

## Usage

### Basic usage

<Canvas
    sourceState="shown"
    of={stories.Default}
/>

### Validation`

You can mark the field as invalid by passing the `isInvalid` prop. This will
apply the red `colorOverlay` to the field.

<Canvas
    sourceState="shown"
    of={stories.Invalid}
/>

Additionally, you can provide an error message to be displayed below the field
using the `FieldError` component.

**Note**: The `FieldError` may also be used without any children, in the context
of a `Form` component, in which case you can pass an object of errors to the
`Form`.

<Canvas
    sourceState="shown"
    of={stories.InvalidWithError}
/>

### Adding a tooltip

A common UI pattern is to provide additional information about a field, such as
formatting requirements or examples. This can be done by adding a `Tooltip`
component to the label.

<Canvas
    sourceState="shown"
    of={stories.LabelTooltip}
/>

### Password / visibility

For password fields, or other secret fields, you can compose an input with a
button to toggle visibility. Under the hood, the `TextFieldVisibilityButton`
leverages the `slot` pattern from React Aria.
[(documentation)](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/advanced.html#slots)

**Note:** This implementation uses the `password` type for the input to leverage
native masking of the value, meaning password managers will pick this up as a
password field.

<Canvas
    sourceState="shown"
    of={stories.Visibilty}
/>
