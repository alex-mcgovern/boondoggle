# Button

## Introduction

`Button` is a simple wrapper around the html5 `button` element, with support for
style variants, quick customisation via `getSprinkles` and an `as` prop that
enables polymorphism, (e.g. if you would like to return an `<a>` element, or a
custom `Link` component instead of the normal `<button>` element.).

## Usage

### `as` prop (polymorphism)

`Button` is a polymorphic component that accepts an `as` prop to change the
underlying HTML element. By default it will return a `<button>` element.

You can pass the name of a generic HTML element, like `a` for an `<a>` tag:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExamplePolymorphismGenericAnchorTag} />

Or you can pass a React component. E.g. in this case, we are passing a custom
Link component, similar to the one provided by frameworks like Reach Router,
NextJS or Gatsby.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExamplePolymorphismReactComponent} />

### Appearance

The `Button` comes with three `appearance` variants:

- `primary` buttons for the main action that draws the user's attention.
- `secondary` buttons are for alternative actions with less emphasis.
- `tertiary` buttons are for additional actions with the least visual emphasis
  and should not be used for frequent or important actions.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.AppearanceSecondary} />
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.AppearanceTertiary} />

### Color

The `Button` has 3 color variants:

- `default` is the default color.
- `green` should be used for actions that are positive or affirmative, like
  "Save" or "Submit".
- `red` should be used for actions that are negative or destructive, like
  "Delete" or "Cancel".

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ColorGreen} />
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ColorRed} />

### Customisation

- Button allows customization through top-level props.
- The props map to the `getSprinkles` utility for composing additional styles.

### "slot" props

To allow more fine-grained control over the bundling of dependencies, the
`Button` component does not include any icon library. Instead, it accepts a
`slotLeft` and `slotRight` prop, which can be used to render any React node
inside the button, on the corresponding side.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.SlotLeftIcon} />
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.SlotRightIcon} />
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.SlotRightLoader} />

### Size

The `Button` has three size variants: `"sm"`, `"md"`, and `"lg"`.

- `"sm"` is for small secondary content, like nav bars or sidebars
- `"md"` is the default size, and meets Apple's minimum tap target size
  requirements
- `"lg"` is for edge cases, like marketing CTAs

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.SizeSm} />
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.SizeMd} />
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.SizeLg} />

### State

The `Button` component has state-specific styles that respective the following
selectors

- :hover
- :focus-visible
- \[disabled] or \[aria-disabled="true"]

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.StateHover} />
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.StateFocusVisible} />
<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.StateDisabled} />
