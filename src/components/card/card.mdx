# Card

## Overview

`Card` is a simple container component that can be used to group content. It's
purpose is to minimise repetition, and ensure consistent appearance of card
content.

`Card` accepts all arguments for `getSprinkles`, and may also be polymorphic
using the `as` prop. When configured to return a `<button>` or `<a>` element, it
will automatically apply hover/focus state styles.

## Usage

### `as` prop (polymorphism)

`Card` is a polymorphic component that accepts an `as` prop to change the
underlying HTML element. By default it will return a `<button>` element.

You can pass the name of a generic HTML element, like `a` for an `<a>` tag:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExamplePolymorphismGenericAnchorTag} />

Or you can pass a React component. E.g. in this case, we are passing a custom
Link component, similar to the one provided by frameworks like Reach Router,
NextJS or Gatsby.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExamplePolymorphismReactComponent} />

### Styling `Card` with "sprinkles"

`Card` accepts all arguments for `getSprinkles`, which is a utility function
provided by
[Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/packages/sprinkles/)
that allows quick composition of a minimal set of utility CSS classes. This
allows you to quickly style elements inline by passing CSS rules as props â€”
think of it a bit like Tailwind CSS, but with a bit more structure in the markup
and intellisense and type-safety.

E.g. here we override the default padding of `spacing3` with `spacing5`:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExampleBasicSprinkles} />

# Props

<ArgsTable of={Card} />
```
