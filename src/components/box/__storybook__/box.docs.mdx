# Box

## Polymorphic component with a wide range of styling options.

This component uses
[Dessert Box](https://github.com/TheMightyPenguin/dessert-box) to create a
component that accepts all of the arguments for `getSprinkles`, a global util
for composing a set of pre-defined utility CSS classes (see
[Vanilla Extract's Sprinkles API](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/packages/sprinkles/)).

It can also return any valid HTML element via the `as` prop, or merge props onto
another React component (though this is not recommmended for complex
components).

`Box` is basically a low level building block for building other components,
rapidly protyping and building page layouts.

## Usage

### Using the `as` to return an element other than a div

`Box` is a polymorphic component that accepts an `as` prop to change the
underlying HTML element. By default it will return a `<div>` element.

You can compose generic html elements:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExamplePolymorphismListItems} />

Or you can pass a React component. E.g. in this case, we are passing a custom
Link component, similar to the one provided by frameworks like Reach Router,
NextJS or Gatsby.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExamplePolymorphismReactComponent} />

### Styling with "sprinkles"

All of the arguments for `getSprinkles` are available as props on `Box`. E.g.
here we can add some background, border, border-radius and padding to mmake this
look a bit more card-like.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExampleBasicSprinkles} />

Note that some properties defined in `getSprinkles` support responsive values,
which can be passed as an object:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExampleResponsiveSprinkles} />

### Styling `Box` with "escape hatch props"

`Box` also exposes a set of "escape hatch" props that allow you to pass any
valid CSS value to the corresponding CSS property. (See relevant section in
[Dessert Box documentation](https://github.com/TheMightyPenguin/dessert-box#escape-hatch)).
You can access these props by prefixing the CSS property with `__`, e.g.
`__margin` or `__padding`.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExampleEscapeHatchStyles} />

## Advanced usage examples

### Example: Composing multiple `Box` components to create an `Alert` component

Here we have composed several `Box` components to create a custom `Alert`. By
using the `background` and `color` props we can add a bit of semantic meaning to
the elements in the `Alert`. Note the use of the `as` prop to render the title
and description as a `<h3>` and `<p>` respectively. This is how we would
typically build a component like this in the component library.

<Canvas of={stories.BoxAsWarning} />
<Canvas of={stories.BoxAsConfirmation} />

### Box as grid layout

<Canvas of={stories.BoxAsGridLayout} />

### Box as list

# Props

<ArgTypes of={Box} />
```
