# Box

## Overview

`Box` is the lowest level component in the component library. It's purpose is to
provide a consistent and fast way to write and style markup. Most other
components in the library are built on top of `Box`.

It follows the commonly used **"Box component"** design pattern. Other examples
of this approach can be found in
[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-box/),
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/box) and
[Braid Design System](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Box/).

## Usage

### `as` prop (polymorphism)

`Box` is a polymorphic component that accepts an `as` prop to change the
underlying HTML element. By default it will return a `<div>` element.

You can compose generic html elements:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExamplePolymorphismGenericElements} />

Or you can pass a React component. E.g. in this case, we are passing a custom
Link component, similar to the one provided by frameworks like Reach Router,
NextJS or Gatsby.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExamplePolymorphismReactComponent} />

### Styling `Box` with "sprinkles"

`Box` accepts all arguments for `getSprinkles`, which is a utility function
provided by
[Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/packages/sprinkles/)
that allows quick composition of a minimal set of utility CSS classes. This
allows you to quickly style elements inline by passing CSS rules as props â€”
think of it a bit like Tailwind CSS, but with a bit more structure in the markup
and intellisense and type-safety.

E.g. here we pass keywords for background, border, border-radius and padding:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExampleBasicSprinkles} />

Note that some properties defined in `getSprinkles` support responsive values,
which can be passed as an object:

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExampleResponsiveSprinkles} />

### Styling `Box` with "escape hatch props"

`Box` also exposes a set of "escape hatch" props that allow you to pass any
valid CSS value to the corresponding CSS property. (See relevant section in
[Dessert Box documentation](https://github.com/TheMightyPenguin/dessert-box#escape-hatch)).
You can access these props by prefixing the CSS property with `__`, e.g.
`__margin` or `__padding`.

<Canvas sourceState="shown" of={stories.ExampleEscapeHatchStyles} />

## Advanced usage examples

### Example: Composing multiple `Box` components to create an `Alert` component

Here we have composed several `Box` components to create a custom `Alert`. By
using the `background` and `color` props we can add a bit of semantic meaning to
the elements in the `Alert`. Note the use of the `as` prop to render the title
and description as a `<h3>` and `<p>` respectively. This is how we would
typically build a component like this in the component library.

<Canvas of={stories.BoxAsWarning} />
<Canvas of={stories.BoxAsConfirmation} />

### Box as grid layout

<Canvas of={stories.BoxAsGridLayout} />

### Box as list

# Props

<ArgsTable of={Box} />
