## Usage

The Switch component has a compositional API comprising of 3 components:

-   `Switch` - the main component that wraps the `SwitchInput` and
    `SwitchLabel`, and provides the state management and switch functionality.
-   `SwitchIndicator` - the visual representation of the switch state.
-   `SwitchLabel` - the label for the switch.

<Canvas
    sourceState="shown"
    of={stories.Default}
/>

The positioning of the `SwitchIndicator` relative to the `SwitchLabel` can be
controlled by composing the components differently.

> ⚠️ **Typically, the correct way is to label the switch with whatever the "on"
> state is, and position that label to the right of the switch.**

<Canvas
    sourceState="shown"
    of={stories.Reversed}
/>
