# Boondoggle.design

## A collection of CSS & components to make building UIs in React faster

An opinionated take on a component library and styling framework that attempts to abstract the
_slowness and repetitiveness_ of building UI by offering a simple set of components, with a unified
set of utility CSS "sprinkles" (thanks [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) ðŸ’™), which
are compatible with _any_ component to allow type-safe, "Tailwind-like" inline styling in a
type-safe, "React-ful" way.

By relying heavily on (pre-processed) vanilla CSS, base HTML5 elements, and with a little help from
battle-tested, open-source libraries like [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/),
[Downshift JS](https://www.downshift-js.com/) and
[React Hook Form](https://@alex-mcgovern/react-hook-form.com), Boondoggle attempts to cover "most of
the bases", while keeping things simple and lightweight.

My goal is to give you tools to build a complete and polished UI with a minimal bundle footprint and
a buttery-smooth developer experience, _without wasting a lot of time reinventing the wheel_.
