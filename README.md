## A collection of CSS & components to make building UIs in React faster

It's an opinionated take on a component library and styling framework that
attempts to abstract the _slowness and repetitiveness_ of building UI by
offering a simple set of components, with a unified set of utility CSS
"sprinkles" (thanks [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) ðŸ’™), which
are compatible with _any_ component to allow "Tailwind-like" inline styling in a
type-safe, "React-ful" way.

By relying heavily on (pre-processed) vanilla CSS, base HTML5 elements, and with
a little help from battle-tested, open-source libraries like
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/),
[Downshift JS](https://www.downshift-js.com/) and
[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com), Boondoggle attempts to cover
"most of the bases", while keeping things simple and lightweight.

My goal is to give you tools to build a complete and polished UI with a minimal
bundle footprint and a buttery-smooth developer experience, _without wasting a
lot of time reinventing the wheel_.
